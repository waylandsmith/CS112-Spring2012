Bonus Homeworks
==================================
Due: 4/2
----------------------------------

To get "bonus points" and more practice before the final projects, feel free to flesh out or make a new tiny game for credit.  Copy your old homework or
create a new folder for any game you want to work on.


### How to turn them in

For each bonus project you do, create a folder and include a `README.md` which describes what added/did and how to play the game.  Then, use the following
commands to turn the files in:

```
git add .
git commit -m "bonus"
git tag bonus
git push
git push --tags
```

Add `--force` to the `git tag` if you are resubmitting.
