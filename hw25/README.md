Homework 25
================================
Final writeup and Release Game
--------------------------------

Sit down with your group and write a short postmortem on your project wiki about how the project went.  This should include what went right, what went wrong, and what the next step for the project would be if you continued.

Then, release your game.  Feel free to fix any minor bugs that you discovered on Monday in class.

Finally, send us an email (cs112 at hampshire.edu) with a short evaluation of yourself and your partner.  Tell us who did what, how it went, and if you'd work with them again.
