I can generate web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I am semi-comfortable with command line utilities such as
  > ssh, scp, cp, mv, mkdir, cd, cat, and grep

I'm comfortable with the Gedit text editor and GNU Nano line editor.  I can use Emacs and I'm learning to deal with vi.
I can create the simplest of programs in Perl and C, but I don't know them. For that matter, I am aware there's much more to learn with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What I hope to get from the course:
I hope to dive in deep into a single programming language and learn it in a way that will become self-perpetuating. If I can learn to definitively DO something which I can then want to expand on, I'm much more likely to stick with the language than if I learn a few basics but don't understand how to "do" things with the programming language.  Since game are cool and interesting to make, this course seems to be the ideal way to satisfy that goal.
