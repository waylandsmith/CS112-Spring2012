At this point, everyone should have git setup properly. [Follow the instructions](https://github.com/HampshireCS/CS112-Spring2012/wiki/Instructions) for running installing python/pygame on your machine. Then pull this assignment down with `git pull course master` and run `mystery_game.py`.


The mystery game is Iago.

Fill in your answer and run the turnin script.
