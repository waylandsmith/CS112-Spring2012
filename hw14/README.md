Restaurant
--------------

Time to plan out how to represent a restaurant in a game.  Imagine you are making a restaurant simulation game. Make index cards to represent all the classes needed.

Define your Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) cards the way we did at the end of class.  You can find a basic description[here](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/crcModel.htm). In addition, put the "superclass" (the one it inherits from) on the top right if there is one.

### Things to keep in mind
 * what items will there be? (plates, food...?)
 * what "concepts"? (recipes, shifts...?)
 * what people need to be represented?
 * groups of people?

### Tip
 * describe your simulation and highlight the nouns
    * these are a good start for what classes you need
