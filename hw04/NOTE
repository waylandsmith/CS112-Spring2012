In case this is uploaded close to the time limit:  this assignment is LATE.  
I do NOT take credit for the point, just the 0 points for having it done (versus -1 for not doing it). 

I don't expect it to matter, but I'm late because I spent most of today reinstalling my OS and reconfiguring Github
thanks to a questionable link from, oddly enough, a Firefox addon (that's what I get for not reading the reviews!). Even if it doesn't get me
credit, it matters to me to note that my lateness isn't because of poor time management / work ethic.  Especially given certain...er...
additions to the assignment.
